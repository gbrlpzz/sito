<p>The value of space is what you do with it. It's more true than ever now in places like Italy where the demographic trend is in freefall. Less people means less demand for real estate: no more passive investment. Space becomes a raw material. </p>
<p>What you do with space will soon be the only source of its value. </p>
<p>The falling prices reflect the decreasing demand. Since 2007 they have been going down, and will further go down, especially in remote and rural areas. This is not exactly true for the big cities, but it is for everywhere else in the country. A  the demographic trend continues prices will continue to fall.</p>

<p>The economics of space will be less that a scarce resource with unlimited demand. Instead it will start behaving like a basic resource that becomes cheaper over time. A raw resource that you must to work with.</p>
<p>The value is then defined by what you can do with it, the community that you can create, and who inhabits it.  This enables much experimentation and risk-taking. Even if it's bad for boomer portfolios, it's great the cultural vitality. As more young people start experimenting with new ways of inhabiting space. </p>
<p>We need to start thinking less about real estate haven investment. But see it as a raw material to re-elaborate and start imagining the derivative products we can build for it. </p>
<p>Architects must start thinking about people. Who uses the spaces, how engaging they are. Value will not simply be there because of demand. Because there won't be demand. We'll have to find product-market fit like for any other product.</p>
